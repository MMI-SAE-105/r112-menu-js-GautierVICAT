        <p class="intro-txt">In a small village nestled at the foot of the mountains lived a dog named Max. Max was a Golden Retriever with a shining golden coat, known by all the villagers for his kindness and intelligence. Every morning, he would joyfully trot alongside the children, escorting them to school. One day, as an unexpected storm swept over the village, a little girl named Clara, who adored Max, found herself stranded in a distant clearing. The wind howled, and rain poured in torrents, making visibility nearly impossible. Clara was frightened and unsure how to find her way home. Max, noticing her absence, instinctively set out to find her. He sniffed the air, following Clara’s familiar scent despite the flashes of lightning and the roar of thunder. He crossed swollen streams and trudged through muddy paths, unwavering in his determination. Finally, he found her, trembling and soaked under a large tree. Max approached her gently, comforting her by resting his warm head on her knees, then began urging her to follow him. With his encouragement, Clara found the courage to walk through the storm. Guided by Max, she eventually made her way back home, where her worried parents were waiting. From that day on, Max became the hero of the village. He was awarded a beautiful medal engraved with gratitude, and he continued to watch over everyone with unwavering loyalty.</p>
